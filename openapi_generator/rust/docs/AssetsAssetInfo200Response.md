For assets identified in Tenable scans, this attribute contains data only if a scan using [Nessus Plugin ID 45590](https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/45590) has evaluated the asset.  **Note:** If no scan detects an application within 30 days of the scan that originally detected the application, Tenable.io considers the detection of that application expired. As a result, the next time a scan evaluates the asset, Tenable.io removes the expired application from the installed_software attribute. This activity is logged as a `remove` type of `attribute_change` update in the asset activity log. | [optional]
