/// ExportsVulnsRequestExportRequestFilters : Specifies filters for exported vulnerabilities.  **Note:** By default, vulnerability exports will only include accepted and non-accepted vulnerabilities found or fixed within the last 30 days if no time-based filters (`indexed_at`, `last_fixed`, `last_found`, or `first_found`) are submitted with the request.

This parameter is required if your request includes `first_found`, `last_found`, or `last_fixed` parameters. If your request omits this parameter, the export includes default states `OPEN` and `REOPENED` only.  Note that the API uses different terms for vulnerability states than the user interface. The `new` and `active` states in the user interface map to the `open` state in the API. The `resurfaced` state in the user interface maps to the `reopened` state in the API. The `fixed` state is the same.

If your request specifies multiple sources, Tenable Vulnerability Management returns all vulnerabilities seen by any of the specified sources.   The items in the `source` array must correspond to the names of the sources as defined in your organization's implementation of Tenable Vulnerability Management. Commonly used source names include:  - AWS—The vulnerability data was obtained from an Amazon Web Services connector.  - AGENT—The vulnerability data was obtained from a Tenable Nessus Agent scan.  - NNM—The vulnerability data was obtained from a Tenable Nessus Network Monitor (NNM) scan.  - NESSUS—The vulnerability data was obtained from a Tenable Nessus scan.
