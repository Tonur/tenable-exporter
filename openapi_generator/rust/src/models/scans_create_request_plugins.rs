/// ScansCreateRequestPlugins : A list of plugins to add to the non-remediation scans. Use the [GET /plugins/families](ref:io-plugins-families-list) endpoint to get a list of plugin families to choose from. Then, use the [GET /plugins/families/{id}](ref:io-plugins-family-details) endpoint to find plugins within the family to add to the scan.  **Note:** This form displays limited parameters. The example below illustrates how to add two plugins within the `Web Servers` plugin family to a scan.
